About me
====
I am a Computer Science PhD Candidate at Purdue University advised by [Dr. Antonio Bianchi]{https://antoniobianchi.me/} and part of the [PurSec]{https://pursec.cs.purdue.edu/} research group. My research revolves around security of mobile systems and IoT devices. I focus on analyzing mobile apps which are the cornerstone for bridging a plethora of communication channels. I am also interested in exploring the interactions of end-users and developers of mobile devices and how can we improve the security of mobile devices by understanding these interactions. I am open to collaborations and discussions on these topics.
